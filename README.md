\# Orbit Simulation



This project simulates satellite orbits around Earth using Python. 



As I am starting my career in a new domain, I would like to know more about Orbital Mechanics, physics and mathematics behind it.

It is a Beginner project to learn about orbital mechanics + numerical simulation in Python.



\###Goal:



\- Simulate satellite orbit around Earth in 2D and 3D

\- visualize trajectory

\- learn Git + GitHub along the way

\- Add all Keplerian orbital elements support

\- Add J2 perturbation (Earth oblateness)

\- Add atmospheric drag

\- Add thrust / manoeuvres

\- Ground track plotting

\- Compute orbital parameters while simulating

\- Add multiple satellites + collision check
